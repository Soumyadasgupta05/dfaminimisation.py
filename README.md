The code accepts excel files. The excel file to be entered must contain two sheets. In the first sheet, the first row would contain the states of the dfa entered as single characters. Please note that the state names must be single characters. The second row contains the characters of the alphabet again entered as single characters. The first cell of the 3rd row must contain the initial state and the 4th row contains the final states. The second sheet must contain the delta function matrix ONLY. Things have been clarified further in the comments included in the program.
